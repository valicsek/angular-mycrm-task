# Description

We would like to have a portal to which we can log in (hardcoded user in backend) where we can see all our Accounts that have a related open opportunity of 1.000 $ or more (amount >= 1000) on a map. An opportunity counts as open when the sales_stage is not 'Closed Won' or 'Closed Lost'.

When a pointer on the map is selected we would like to see the account name and address as well as the newest opportunity's name, sales_stage and amount.

# Technologies to use
Google Maps as map provider
Nodejs for backend
React, Angular or ExtJS for frontend

# My approach
So basically, I prefer to separate the server side and a client side to another ports.
